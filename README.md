# Clip_Engine

Clipping software that can clip almost any game with detection, API, etc. A competitor to Medal.

## What works today

- Detects The Finals, Overwatch and Battlefield 6 and starts recording on the monitor the game is on, stopping when it closes.
- Captures at the monitor's native resolution and refresh rate with Windows.Graphics.Capture. Nothing is injected into the game, so it is safe with anti-cheat.
- Encodes on the GPU (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel) with H.264, switching to HEVC when the resolution and frame rate need it.
- Keeps the last 60 seconds in memory; press **F8** to save the last 30 seconds as an MP4 with separate game and mic audio tracks.

- A desktop app (`ClipEngine.exe`) with a liquid-glass look: live recording status, a Save clip button, a clip gallery with thumbnails, the supported games and all the settings. It runs the engine for you and keeps recording from the tray.

Automatic clips for kills, assists, deaths and other moments come next.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1903 or newer (Windows 11 recommended, so the yellow capture border can be turned off)
- A GPU with a hardware video encoder (practically any GPU from the last ten years)

## Installing

Download the zip from the [latest release](../../releases/latest), unzip it anywhere and run `ClipEngine.exe`.

## Building

Install Visual Studio 2022 or newer with the **Desktop development with C++** workload, which includes CMake and the Windows SDK, and the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0). Then:

```
cmake -S . -B build -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
dotnet publish ui/ClipEngine.Desktop -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o dist
copy build\Release\clip_engine.exe dist\
```

`dist\ClipEngine.exe` is the app, and it expects `clip_engine.exe` next to it. Every push to a pull request also builds both on GitHub Actions; the run's artifacts have the ready-to-run folder and screenshots of the app.

To see the app without Windows, `dotnet run --project ui/ClipEngine.Desktop.Preview -- screenshots` renders every screen with sample data to PNGs. `dotnet test ui/ClipEngine.Desktop.Tests` runs the app's tests.

To publish a release, set the version in `CMakeLists.txt` and run the **Release** workflow from the Actions tab.

## Using it

Run `ClipEngine.exe` and launch a supported game. `clip_engine.exe` can also run on its own, in which case its console shows what is being recorded.

- Settings: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Clip_Engine\clip_engine.ini` (created on first run, with comments)
- Log: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Clip_Engine\clip_engine.log`
- Clips: `Videos\Clip_Engine\<Game>\`
